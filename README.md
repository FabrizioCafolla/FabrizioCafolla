I'm a **DevOps & Cloud Engineer** with a great passion for innovating technology, writing and traveling as a Digital Nomad.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with very different business realities, from SMBs to enterprises, and to immerse myself in the Startup ecosystem.

In my daily work, I deal with cloud architectures and CI/CD process automation, but beyond that, I love experimenting with new technologies and traveling as a digital nomad.

My passions and curiosity merge with another passion of mine, which is writing and sharing what I discover and experience with others.

### My philosophy

I am a strong believer in the Open-Source philosophy. I firmly believe that free, accessible, and transparent sharing is the fundamental engine of technological and human progress. For this reason, I am committed to sharing every one of my projects and articles in an open way.

This is why I founded Italia Open-Source, a community that enhances the Italian tech scene by giving visibility to open-source projects, communities, and everything that revolves around the Italian tech sector, promoting the values of transparency and collaboration.
I am also the Community Manager of Latina in Tech, a community created to bring tech events to our city. With Latina in Tech, we try to create an environment where collaboration, sharing, and new opportunities can thrive.
