My name is Fabrizio Cafolla and I’m a DevOps & Platform Engineer.
In my work, I mainly focus on designing cloud architectures and automating CI/CD processes, with the goal of making life easier for development teams and improving the reliability of software delivery.

I work primarily with AWS and GCP, managing infrastructure through IaC, mainly using Terraform. The languages I use most are Python and Bash, with some experience in TypeScript and Go, which I’m continuing to explore.
Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work with very different kinds of organizations: small and medium-sized businesses, corporate environments in the banking sector, and startup ecosystems. This has helped me understand how important it is to adapt tools, processes, and technical solutions to the context and the people you work with, rather than the other way around.

I’m very connected to the open-source world and to knowledge sharing. I firmly believe that free, accessible, and transparent sharing is the fundamental engine of technological and human progress. That’s why I try to document and share what I do through projects, articles, and content on my blog.
From this mindset, [Europan OpenSource](https://europeanopensource.eu/) was born (a spin-off of Italia Open-Source): a community-driven platform designed to highlight the European tech landscape, open-source projects, communities, and all the organizations working in the tech space across Europe.

I’m also the Community Manager of Latina in Tech, an initiative created to bring quality tech events to my city, build connections between companies and developers, and foster an environment based on collaboration and sharing.

Outside of work, I love to travel whenever I get the chance. In recent years, I’ve often worked as a digital nomad, which has allowed me to experience different cultures and ways of living. Many of these trips eventually turn into guides and stories on my blog, where I try to combine the more technical side with the more personal one.
